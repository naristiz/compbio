I just had my first first-author scientific paper accepted for publication and I'm stoked. I want to share the main findings of my work with my academic peers and non-scientific audiences. 

## Main questions

- \color{orange}How does landscape structure affect pest control by ants in sun-exposed coffee farms?
\bigskip
- \color{purple}What ecological processes are behind "pest control by ants" and how are they affected differently by land-use change?
\bigskip
- \color{blue}Are ecological processes affected at different scales?

## Hypothesis

- \color{orange}Forest loss will decrease pest control services provided by ants
\bigskip
- \color{purple}Ants will defend more coffee plants and predate more on coffee borer beetle with increasing forest cover
\bigskip
- \color{blue}Results will be scale-dependent 


## How did we answer these questions?

 {We set camp in sun-exposed coffee farms in Brazil and followed one year of coffee production. We set up 300 ant-exclusion traps in ten 2-km radii landscapes that varied in forest cover and compare abundance of \textbf{coffee berry borer, CBB} with and without ants. We measured CBB at three different stages as indicators of the different ecological proceses involved in pest control by ants.}

## We controlled for 

> - \color{purple}farm management
\bigskip
> - \color{yellow}coffee variety
\bigskip


## Independent variables and landscape metrics

> - presence/absence of ants
\bigskip
> - forest cover in 2 km radii around ant-exclusion experiments
\bigskip
> - forest cover in 300 m radii around ant-exclusion experiments
\bigskip
> - coffee cover in 300 m radii around ant-exclusion experiments
\bigskip
> - distance to nearest forest fragment from ant-exclusion experiments

Stay tuned! As soon as the paper is officially online and ready to be shared, I'll update this slide. For now an example of a coffee berry borer attacking coffee beans on next slide.
